My Plan for iConnect

BACKEND
1) setup user Signup Login with Spotify via SocialAuth
2) Set up GeoDjango, with location data  #done
3) Locate closest playlist #skip as have map-viz


FRONTEND: JS + React
1) Spotify Login Page
2) Map Viz  #done
3) Show nearby users + interaction  #done
4) get playlist URI and open in spotify



STILL TO WORK OUT
* user logging in with Spotify SocialAuth, and getting token
* Sending the spotify token to django to swap for auth token
* getting user's playlist URI to add to DB
* sending fetch get request when we have the user's location


GENERAL
how to send Post requests?
